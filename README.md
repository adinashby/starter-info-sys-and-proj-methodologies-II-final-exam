# Information System and Project Methodologies II - Final Exam

This template repository is the starter project for Integrative Project in Information System and Project Methodologies II Final Exam. Written in C#.

## Instructions
- This exam is **open book**, and you are allowed to use the internet. However, **you cannot use AI tools or collaborate with others to solve the problems.**
- You must design and implement two **independent game features**, each requiring the integration of **two design patterns**.
- Clearly explain your **choice of design patterns** and how they interact within the game.
- Submit your **source code** along with a **short documentation** describing the design choices and implementation details.

## Question 1: Implement a Game Asset Management System (50%)

### Problem Statement
You are tasked with developing a **Game Asset Management System** that efficiently loads, caches, and provides access to game assets such as textures, models, and sound files. Your implementation should incorporate at least **two design patterns** from the following list:

- **Flyweight**: Optimize memory usage by sharing common assets among different game objects.
- **Facade**: Provide a simplified interface for asset loading and retrieval.
- **Proxy**: Implement lazy loading of assets, loading them only when needed.
- **Bridge**: Separate abstraction (asset types) from implementation (asset storage methods).

### Requirements
- Implement at least **two design patterns** from the above list.
- Write a short report (a page or less) explaining how the design patterns were applied and their benefits.
- Your implementation should be **object-oriented** and well-structured.
- Ensure the code is **modular** and follows **SOLID principles**.

## Question 2: Implement a Character Customization System (50%)

### Problem Statement
You are required to develop a **Character Customization System** that allows players to customize their characterâ€™s appearance, attributes, and abilities. The system should support flexible object creation and allow modifications to the character without modifying its core structure. Your implementation should incorporate at least **two design patterns** from the following list:

- **Prototype**: Enable cloning of character templates to quickly create new characters with predefined attributes.
- **Builder**: Provide a structured way to construct a character step by step.
- **Factory Method**: Encapsulate character creation logic for different character classes (e.g., Warrior, Mage, Rogue).
- **Bridge**: Decouple character abstraction (appearance, abilities) from its implementation (different storage formats or rendering engines).

### Requirements
- Implement at least **two design patterns** from the above list.
- Write a short report (a page or less) explaining how the design patterns were applied and their benefits.
- Your implementation should be **object-oriented** and well-structured.
- Ensure the code is **modular** and follows **SOLID principles**.

---

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Correctness (70%)**: The game feature meets the functional requirements and integrates the selected design patterns properly.
- **Code Quality (10%)**: The implementation follows clean code practices, including modularity and proper naming conventions.
- **Documentation (20%)**: A brief report explaining the system architecture, why certain patterns were chosen, and how they improve the system.

This final exam assesses your ability to **apply, combine, and justify** the use of advanced design patterns in game development. **Good luck!**
